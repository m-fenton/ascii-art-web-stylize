ascii-art-web-stylize

This project takes the premise of the original ascii-art-web project but with more emphasis on the html and css style elements.

The project is run the same way as before -
    
1.  Within the project path: "go run .", to run the server.
2.  In the web browser, go to localhost:8080
3.  Here the user can chose between 3 banners, shadow, standard and thinkertoy.
4.  In the text area below, the user can input up to 2 lines
5.  After pressing submit, the ascii art version is returned with the banner chosen.
